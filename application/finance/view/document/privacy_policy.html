	   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Privacy Policy("Policy")was written in English (US) and will be the agreement between You and Sweet Live ("We") while you are using Sweet Live's applications ("APP"). To the extent any translated version of this Policy conflicts against the English version, this English version prevails.</p>
	   <p>Date of Last Revision: January 17, 2018</p>
	   <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Summary</span></p>
	   <p>You should read this privacy policy because it will tell you exactly how your personal data is being looked after by Sweet Live and it is very important for you to know. Here are the topics that we cover:</p>
	   <p>1. What information we collect and how we collect it.</p>
	   <p>2. How we use the information and who we share it with.</p>
	   <p>3. How you can access and update such information.</p>
	   <p>4. How we protect the information we store about you.</p>
	   <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The full legal bit</span></p>
	   <p>We know that other people’s use of your personal data is a big concern for social network users, so we at Sweet Live have developed this privacy policy (the "Policy") to let you know how we use personal information ('personal data' or 'personal information').
	<p>Our Policy applies to your use of the Sweet Live website at www.Sweet Liveus.com (“Sweet Live” or the “site” which includes APP). We suggest you read it in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”). When you access or use Sweet Live, you agree to our Privacy Policy and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as we’ve set out in this Policy.</p>

		<p>To join the Sweet Live you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender) your information at any time by just logging in to Sweet Live.</p>
		
		<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">What information does Sweet Live collect</span></p>

We may from time to time allow our employees to use the product for testing and user engagement purposes.</p>
		<p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts (because we want to make sure you are not a robot!) and might ask for your phone number or Facebook Account.

		<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">5. Your rights</span></p>
<p>You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Once you register, you will be able to review and change much of your personal information except gender. If you want to stop using your account it will be initially deactivated. This means that no user will be able to search for you on App although they may still see you profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Sweet Live. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it.
After the expiration of 30 days, your account is permanently deleted from Sweet Live. We delete photographs from our servers within 14 days from the expiration of the deactivation period while other information (such as contact history) is deleted by us over a longer timescale, by way of housekeeping on a periodic basis. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to restore it.
To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Sweet Live by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account We shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.
